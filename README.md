# Forms Wizard

Description is comming soonâ€¦


## Quickstart

```bash
nix develop
```

This builds **`Forms Wizard`** using the latest curated versions (defined at `flake.lock`) of `forms-designer` and `@formswizard/processing`.

After all build artifacts are created, a dev-build is started (hot-reloading changes to the main app) and opening it at your [Browser](http://localhost:3000).
